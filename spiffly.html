      <p class="work-summary">Spiffly is a marketplace for good. A place for B2P -- that's business to prosumer -- transactions. By giving these super users a discount on products the businesses get paid to market and the prosumers get products at a significantly reduced cost compared to the general public.
      <br><br>
      I built the front-end of Spiffly, an e-commerce site, in less than 100 hours never having worked with Swig or Sass in my life.</p>
